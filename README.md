# Learning Truly Monotone Operators with Applications to Nonlinear Inverse Problems

Code for the paper: [Learning Truly Monotone Operators with Applications to Nonlinear Inverse Problems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.00390)

# Pre-requisites:

The code was ran on python 3.8 and pytorch 1.8 (not present in the requirements.txt) a necessary package is needed to run this code: [ImageToolbox](https://github.com/Youyoun/imageToolbox/tree/main)

Make sure to install the correct version of pytorch, and then install the requirements:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Training

All training scripts are present in the scripts folder, these run the main.py module with some pre-fixed arguments.

# TODO:

- More comprehensive guide on how to run the trainings
